# Deep Learning Adventure

This is an educational purpose repository, where I try to reimplement PyTorch for training artificial neural networks.

## Checklist

Implement Layers
- [X] Linear
- [X] ReLu
- [ ] Drop out

Implement optimizers
- [X] SGD
- [ ] Momentum
- [ ] Adam

Optional
- [ ] GPU?

### Updates 

2026-Feb-7: Created a torch like minimal framework with SGD algorithm, ReLU, Linear layer, MSE and tested it against the AND gate. It's made with numpy and only runs on CPU. I explored how torch autograd works a bit and might look more into that in the future. Next thing I plan is to implement more optimizers and try them out on a deeper network.
